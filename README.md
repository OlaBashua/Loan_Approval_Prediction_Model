# Loan_Approval_Prediction_Model
Capstone project loan approval prediction model

### Project Objectives and Goals

This project aims to build a machine-learning model to predict loan approval based on a customer dataset. The project aims to leverage customer data to make informed decisions on which customers should be approved or denied loans in the future. Essentially, the project targets to mitigate risk and maximize ROI for the bank.


## Project Workflow

#### Data Preprocessing:
 I performed thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to ensure the dataset's quality and uniformity. Calculated new variables, created a refined dataset, and encoded categorical variables. Dataset used: Customer_loan.csv


#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis to gain insights into the relationships between various features and loan approval outcomes. Visualization techniques were utilized to identify trends and patterns within the data.

#### Model Building: 
Split the data into training and testing sets, applied feature scaling and PCA, built and trained a Na√Øve Bayes model, and evaluated the model using a confusion matrix.

## Conclusion

Loan Approval Prediction Project: Conducted analysis on a financial dataset to predict loan approval outcomes and developed a machine learning model to assess creditworthiness with an accuracy of 85.5%.

In this project, I worked with a comprehensive financial dataset containing relevant information about loan applicants, such as credit history, income, loan amount, and other essential factors. The primary objective was to identify the key determinants that influence loan approval decisions and create a predictive model to assess the likelihood of loan approval for future applicants.
